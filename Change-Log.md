## Architectural Refactor & UI Overhaul

This release marks a significant milestone for the Mind Map Editor. The entire application has been refactored from a single monolithic script into a modular, multi-file architecture. This change dramatically improves code maintainability, scalability, and organization. Alongside this structural overhaul, the user interface has been completely redesigned for a more modern, intuitive, and feature-rich experience.

### 🚀 Major Architectural Refactor

The core of this update is the move from a single-file application to a clean, multi-file project structure.

-   **Old:** A single Python script containing all UI, logic, and graphics classes.
-   **New:** The application is now split into logical components:
    -   `Mind_Map.py`: The clean application entry point.
    -   `ui_components.py`: Contains all primary UI widgets like `MainWindow`, `EditorPanel`, `TitleBar`, and the new `LoadingIndicator`.
    -   `graphics_items.py`: Manages all `QGraphicsScene`-related classes, including `Node`, `Connection`, and `MindMapView`.
    -   `app_utils.py`: A utility module for shared resources like the `StyleSheet` manager, `AIWorker` thread, and the new `IconFactory`.

This refactoring makes the codebase significantly easier to navigate, debug, and extend in the future.

### 🎨 UI/UX Overhaul

The user interface has been redesigned from the ground up to be more powerful and visually appealing.

| Feature | Old Version | New Version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Theming** | Hardcoded dark theme. | **Dual theme support (Dark/Light)** with a dynamic `StyleSheet` manager. The entire UI, including icons and the canvas, adapts instantly. |
| **Toolbar** | A mix of a `QToolBar` and separate `QPushButton`s in a grid layout. | A **single, unified `QToolBar`** holds all primary actions (New, Open, Save, Render, AI, Export), the search box, and a new View options menu. |
| **Icons** | Standard system icons. | **Custom, theme-aware SVG icons** generated by a new `IconFactory`. Icons are tinted to match the current theme for perfect visual consistency. |
| **AI Feedback** | The "Enhance" button text changed to "Processing...". | A dedicated, animated **`LoadingIndicator`** provides clear visual feedback during AI operations without altering button text. |
| **Layout** | Basic `QSplitter` layout with `QFrame` for the editor panel. | A more robust `QGridLayout`-based main window with a refined `QSplitter` and dedicated widget classes for a cleaner look and feel. The editor panel is now a custom widget. |
| **Status Bar**| A simple `QLabel` acting as a breadcrumb. | A proper **status bar area** at the bottom of the editor panel, containing the breadcrumb label and the `LoadingIndicator`. |

### ✨ New Features

-   **Canvas Grid:** The mind map view now renders a background grid, aiding in node alignment and providing better spatial context.
-   **Snap-to-Grid:** Implemented an optional "snap-to-grid" functionality, allowing users to neatly align nodes for a more organized map.
-   **Middle-Mouse Panning:** In addition to left-click dragging, the canvas can now be intuitively panned by holding and dragging the middle mouse button.
-   **View Controls:** Added "Fit All" (`Home`) and "Zoom to Selection" (`F`) actions to a new View menu for easier canvas navigation.

### 🔧 Enhancements & Fixes

-   **Robust PNG Export:** The export logic has been rewritten to intelligently calculate the bounding box of all nodes and export a perfectly cropped PNG image.
-   **Improved AI Integration:** The `AIWorker` now provides more user-friendly error messages, especially for connection issues with the Ollama service.
-   **Streamlined Actions:** All user actions are now proper `QAction` objects, allowing for standardized shortcuts, tooltips, and menu integration.
-   **Performance:** Decoupling UI components and graphics items improves rendering performance and overall application responsiveness.
-   **Removed Clutter:** Removed the non-functional SVG export option to avoid user confusion, focusing on a high-quality PNG export.
